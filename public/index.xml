      <description>The other day, while enjoying one of the most productive days, I thought to myself why? Why am I feeling productive working from home today? I realized that within an hour, before even opening my computer to for work, I had started the day with accomplishment instead of frustration.&#xA;Frustration from staring at a car’s rear bumper for 1 hour straight. Sighing audibly or silently from “other’s” driving habits on the busy 08:00 AM Athens roads.</description>
